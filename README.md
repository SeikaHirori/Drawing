- [ ] 1. Create an Arrow shape â€“ having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw.
    - Note:
        - Create a separate triangle and rectangle to create an arrow 
        
    - WIP
- [ ] 2. Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
- [ ] 3. Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more properties.
    - Sample code of ColorCyclingCircle can be found in section 2.3
